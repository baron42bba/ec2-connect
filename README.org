* ec2-connect
wrapper utility to connect to AWS ec2 instances via SSM.

For some time I was using [[https://github.com/xen0l/aws-gate][aws-gate]].

Then we switched to SSO and it stopped working for me.

Not a fan of Python I wanted just a wrapper to the plain aws utilities
to avoid problems in the future when AWS decides to modify aws cli
behavior.

ec2-connect has some benefits:

- caching e2 instance names
- auto completion
- type to connect to a random instance of a cluster

If you use multiple accounts and ec2 instances you visit regularly you
can configure aliases as well:

create ~/.ec2connect.config with a yaml file like:

#+begin_src yaml
  hosts:
    - alias: vertica-stage01
      name: vertica-stage01
      profile: prod
      region: ap-southeast-1
    - alias: vertica-stage02
      name: vertica-stage02
      profile: prod
      region: ap-southeast-1
    - alias: vertica-test01
      name: vertica-test01
      profile: test
      region: eu-west-1
    - alias: web
      name: apache01
      profile: test
      region: us-east-2
  defaults:
    profile: prod
    region: us-east-2
    
    
#+end_src

To make use of bash completion just add this to your bashrc:

#+begin_src sh
  source <(ec2-connect --bash_completion)
#+end_src

Suggestions are welcome!
